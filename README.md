# pover

Utility script that makes working with package.json files easier.

## Usage

pover tries to find the package.json in your current working directory so make sure that you are in your projects root folder.

**Display all scripts defined in package.json**

```bash
pover
```

**Open the project in the browser (uses "respository" in your package.json)**

```bash
pover repo
```
